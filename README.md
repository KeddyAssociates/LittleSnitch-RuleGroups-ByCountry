# LittleSnitch-RuleGroups-ByCountry
This Rule Group for Little Snitch blocks all IP addresses assigned to a given country.

Subscribe to the corresponding .lsrules file in the directory associated with the country you'd like to block using Little Snitch.

Make sure you're using the url that contains the domain "raw.githubusercontent.com", which you can get from your web browser after clicking on "View Raw" on the corresponding .lsrules page for the country you want to block. Copying the url of the .lsrules page on github will not work (because it returns the github page not the .lsrules file!).
